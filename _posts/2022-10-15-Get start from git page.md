GitPage probably is the best approach to create a FREE blog for recording daily learning activities.
You only need two steps to setup a GitPage:
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

You can find many templates online, I will take an example of a jekyll theme that I like.
git clone https://github.com/Simpleyyt/jekyll-theme-next.git

For using jekyll, here is a user manual in Chinese.
