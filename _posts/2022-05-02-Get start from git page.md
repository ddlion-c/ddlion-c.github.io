GitPage probably is the best approach to create a FREE blog for recording daily learning activities.
You only need two steps to setup a GitPage:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
git clone https://github.com/Simpleyyt/jekyll-theme-next.git
